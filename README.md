# What's this?

Just a bit of fun for my upcoming interview. I plan on coding in my own IDE instead of Coderpad or similar. And instead of needing to screen share the live exercise, I will be hosting it instead at [http://pabonet.duckdns.org:5174/]. And I thought it would be amusing to add a couple of features:

- **Collaborators displayed with name and avatar selection**: Collaborators will be persisted to the server and sent out via websockets to all connected clients. Like a low-fi, hipster Google Docs.
- **Like button**: Smash that like button if I do something heroic like remember how to vertically center something with css.
